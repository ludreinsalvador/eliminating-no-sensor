# **Eliminating NO (Nitric Oxide) Air Quality Sensor for Project Cost Optimization**

---

## Overview
This project analyzes **air quality monitoring sensor data** to identify cost-optimization opportunities. Specifically, I assess the redundancy of the **`no` (Nitric Oxide) sensor** and determine if its removal would maintain data integrity while reducing costs.

---

## Objective
My goal is to evaluate whether the **`no` sensor can be eliminated** without losing crucial data. This is achieved through **statistical correlation analysis** and **linear regression modeling**, using **`no`, `no‚ÇÇ` (Nitrogen Dioxide), and `no‚Çì` (Nitrogen Oxides) sensor data**.

---

## Hypothesis
Eliminating the `no` sensor (Nitric Oxide) in N. Mai, Los Angeles California (CA), will have a minimal impact on overall air quality monitoring. This is based on the strong correlation, interdependence, or redundancy of `no` with other related pollutants, such as `no2` and `nox`. By leveraging data from these sensors, it can effectively derive `no` levels, thereby optimally reducing project expenses while maintaining the integrity of air quality data.

## Sensor Analysis & Observations

- The **`no` sensor** only has **14,008** data points, which is significantly fewer than others.
- The average value of `no` is very low, suggesting a minor environmental impact.
- `no` has similar patterns to `no2` and `nox`, indicating redundancy.

---

### üìà Average Pollutant Concentration
![Average Pollutant Concentration](visualization/avg-pollutant-concentration.png)
- `no` (Nitric Oxide) - one of the lowest average concentration, suggests that it might have less effect on the environment.
- `no2` (Nitrogen Dioxide) - Linked to combustion or burning processes (like automobiles, industries), higher concentration than ‚Äòno‚Äô.
- `nox` (Nitrogen Oxides) - total of no and no2, it has a larger value than ‚Äòno‚Äô but is still very low overall.

---

### üìä Boxplot Value Distribution
![Boxplot](visualization/boxplot-value.png)

---

### üìâ Histogram Distribution of Sensor Values
![Histogram](visualization/histogram-value.png)
- Each bar's height indicates the count.
- Majority of measurements for `no` cluster is just a small percentage in the range. 

---

### üìà Time Series Line Plot
![Line Plot](visualization/line-plot.png)
- Between 2022 and 2023, there is a noticeable gap for every metric, a sign of missing data or sensor failure.
- `nox` has seen a significant increase in results following 2023, indicating either changes to the environment, mistakes in measurement, or adjustments to the data collection process.
- Possibly related to environmental cycles like temperature or human activity, `no2` shows consistent seasonal or periodic behavior.
- Changes in the real world, including increased industrial activity, traffic, or changing seasons in pollutant concentrations, may be the cause of the `no2` moves and the `nox` increase.
- Data gap can be sensors were not working or when problem gathering the data.
- Correlations - the patterns in `no2` and `nox` may be connected.

---

### üîç Sensor Correlation Scatter Plots
![Scatter Plots](visualization/scatter-plots.png)
- [1] `no` vs `no2`
   - There is some correlation between `no` and `no2`, according to the data points. Little disorganized connection.
   - Not entirely dependent on one another.

- [2] `no` vs. `nox`
   - Tight rising trend, strong positive correlation between `no` and `nox`.
   - ‚Äònox‚Äô is sum of `no` and `no2`, this implies that ‚Äòno‚Äô levels significantly contribute to `nox` levels.

- [3] `no2` vs. `nox`
   - `no2` and `nox` have a high positive correlation, just like [2].
   - This shows how `no2` and `nox` are interdependent. Changes in `no2` result in `nox`.

## Predictive Modeling & Redundancy Justification

- A **linear regression model** was built using `no2` and `nox` to predict `no`.
- The model's results show that `no` values can be **precisely predicted** from the other two variables.

### Model Result
- **R¬≤:** `0.9998760560412906`  
- **RMSE:** `0.00013389460874487974`  
- **Coefficients:** `[-1.0005, 1.0027]`  
- **Intercept:** `-2.6839e-05`

These metrics strongly indicate that the `no` sensor adds **no unique value**.

---

## Conclusion

‚úÖ Eliminating the **`no` sensor** does **not impact air quality monitoring performance**.  
‚úÖ The regression model can accurately estimate `no` using `no2` and `nox`.  
‚úÖ This results in **cost savings** for maintenance, hardware, or calibration.  
‚úÖ The approach demonstrates the power of **correlation analysis** and **predictive modeling** in sensor optimization.
