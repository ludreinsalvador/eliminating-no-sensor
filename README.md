# **Eliminating NO (Nitric Oxide) Air Quality Sensor for Project Cost Optimization**

---

## Overview
This project analyzes **air quality monitoring sensor data** to identify cost-optimization opportunities. Specifically, we assess the redundancy of the **`no` (Nitric Oxide) sensor** and determine if its removal would maintain data integrity while reducing costs.

---

## Objective
My goal is to evaluate whether the **`no` sensor can be eliminated** without losing crucial data. This is achieved through **statistical correlation analysis** and **linear regression modeling**, using **`no`, `noâ‚‚` (Nitrogen Dioxide), and `noâ‚“` (Nitrogen Oxides) sensor data**.

---

## Hypothesis
Eliminating the `no` sensor (Nitric Oxide) in N. Mai, Los Angeles California (CA), will have a minimal impact on overall air quality monitoring. This is based on the strong correlation, interdependence, or redundancy of `no` with other related pollutants, such as `no2` and `nox`. By leveraging data from these sensors, it can effectively derive `no` levels, thereby optimally reducing project expenses while maintaining the integrity of air quality data.

## **Conclusion:** Strong correlations suggest sensor redundancy, making `no` a potential candidate for removal.
  - Eliminating the `no` sensor has minimal impact, as `no` can be predicted from `noâ‚‚` and `noâ‚“`.
  - Strong linear relationship and low RMSE confirm the `NO` sensor is redundant.
  - Removing the `NO` sensor reduces costs without affecting the quality of the data.
  - The approach can optimize sensor use in air quality monitoring systems.
